# What's new in ART

## Version v2025.Q3.R0

##### IMPORTANT NOTE: Always run the MOH Cohort Report before running any other MOH or Pepfar reports to get the latest Patient outcomes per given period. If a different period from the run MOH cohort report is detected, the system will automatically rebuild outcomes for the new period which will stretch that report run-time by the MOH cohort report run-time.
